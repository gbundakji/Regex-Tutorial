Welcome!ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Š

## Description

This is a regular expression, regex for short, tutorial for the "Matching a URL" regex: 

<code>/^(https?:\/\/)?([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})([\/\w \.-]*)*\/?$/</code>

This series of characters is known as a regex search pattern that is meant for basic URL validation. I will break down the preceding "Matching a URL" regex in order for us to explore its components. I will be sharing my code snippets and detailed description of this regex in my <a href="https://gist.github.com/gbundakji/8cef9be60cef741a06934fa3a42ac073" target="_blank">GitHub Gist</a>.
